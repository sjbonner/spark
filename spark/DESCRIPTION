Authors@R: person("Simon", "Bonner", , "sbonner6@uwo.ca", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: spark is a tool for speeding the analysis of complex mark-recapture
    data sets by sparsifying the data. The primary function rewrites the capture
    histories separately for each release, instead of each individual, and truncates
    the remaining capture history to reduce the compuational burden. Further
    functions are provided to format data for different software packages.
